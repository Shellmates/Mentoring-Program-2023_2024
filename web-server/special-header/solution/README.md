* When Accessing the page, you will be seeing some html dispalyed in the main page

* As the title of challenge is `Special-Header` and in a web app we mainly talk about HTTP, the first thing to do might be checking the headers of requests and responses

* If you check properly the headers of the response, you will find the following header :

```http
    Flag: "shellmates{1t_$t1ll_n33ds_t0_b3_s3nt_1n_th3_b0dy_th0}"
```
